These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.


* Requirements

We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the GIT repository.
This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges etc.), but imposes more
requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-checked-out sources.
Note the requirements to build the released archive are much less and
are just the requirements of the standard ./configure && make procedure.
Specific development tools and versions will be checked for and listed by
the bootstrap script.  See README-prereq for specific notes on obtaining
these prerequisite tools.

Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> is also highly recommended, if
Valgrind supports your architecture. See also README-valgrind.

While building from a just-cloned source tree may require installing a
few prerequisites, later, a plain `git pull && make' should be sufficient.

* First GIT checkout

You can get a copy of the source repository like this:

        $ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/cssc.git
        $ cd cssc

You also need to get a copy of gnulib:

        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update

The next step is to get and check other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages:

        $ ./bootstrap

If /bin/sh on your system is not POSIX-compatible, then you may need
to run "bootsrap" with a POSIX shell (for example /usr/xpg4/bin/sh on
Solaris).

And there you are!  Just

        $ ./configure --quiet #[--enable-gcc-warnings] [*]
        $ make
        $ make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the GIT master copy:

        $ git diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!

* If it's not your first GIT checkout

We used to check the googletest subdirectory out from svn, but this
has now moved to git.  Therefore you may need to delete any existing
googletest directory before running "bootstrap".


[*] The --enable-gcc-warnings option is useful only with glibc
and with a very recent version of gcc.  You'll probably also have
to use recent system headers.  If you configure with this option,
and spot a problem, please be sure to send the report to the bug
reporting address of this package, and not to that of gnulib, even
if the problem seems to originate in a gnulib-provided file.
