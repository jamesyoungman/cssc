# We keep "tests" as the last named subdirectory in SUBDIRS,
# so that when we do "make check", the "Tests passed" message
# is emitted last (we wouldn't want "entering directory unused"
# messages to make that scroll off the screen).
#
# We run the unit tests before the regression tests in order to make
# it more obvious where the bug is when there is a test failure.

# intended for use with Autotools any more.
