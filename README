This is the README file for GNU CSSC, a workalike for the source code
control system SCCS.  It is based on the MySC package by Ross Ridge.

Although this is a full public release of CSSC, there are features of
the SCCS suite which are not fully implemented.  The most important of
these is excluded deltas.

Specific information about compiling CSSC on particular platforms is
provided in the file "docs/Platforms".

==============================================================================
			Quick Start
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.      Configuring the package

 To configure CSSC before compiling it, run the "configure" script.
 See the file INSTALL for the generic options you can use with "configure".
 Options for "configure" that are specific to CSSC are detailed below.


--enable-binary		   
  
    This is the default setting (but the default setting may change 
    in the future).

    Enables support for creating "binary" SCCS files (required for
    interoperability with Solaris).  If binary support is disabled,
    encoded SCCS files can still be read, but not created.  You should
    disable this feature only if you need to interoperate with a
    version of SCCS which lacks binary file support.

    The setting of this option can be overridden at runtime by setting 
    the environment variable CSSC_BINARY_SUPPORT to "disable".

 --disable-binary

    Turns off suport for creating encoded ("binary") SCCS files.
    CSSC will still handle these as input, but will never create one,
    when this option is used.

    The setting of this option can be overridden at runtime by setting 
    the environment variable CSSC_BINARY_SUPPORT to "enable".

--enable-max-line-length=N 

    The default setting corresponds with N=0.

    Sets the maximum line length allowed in SCCS files to N.  By
    default, CSSC has no limit.  Use this option only if you need to
    make CSSC interoperate with other versions of SCCS.  This limit
    applies only to the actual body lines in the file, and are not 
    checked for (e.g.) comments.  This means that by entering a 
    very long comment, you can make CSSC produce an SCCS file which 
    cannot be read by some other versions of SCCS.

    The setting of this option can be overridden at runtime by setting 
    the environment variable CSSC_MAX_LINE_LENGTH to a positive integer. 
    Setting CSSC_MAX_LINE_LENGTH to 0 removes the limit (and so CSSC will
    handle lines of any length).


--disable-valgrind

    Disables the use of valgrind for the unit and regression tests.
    By default, valgrind will be used if it is available.  If you
    would like to disable valgrind at configure time, pass the
    --disable-valgrind option.  To disable it afterward, you can
    simply set the enviroment variable CSSC_DISABLE_VALGRIND.


1.	Compiling

 You will probably need to compile the software with GNU make.

 The default installation directory for the binaries is 
 /usr/local/libexec/cssc, except for the sccs comand, which gets
 installed in /usr/local/bin.  

 If you want to change this, you will need to read the file INSTALL.

 If, for example, you want to install the files in /usr/libexec/cssc
 and so on rather than in /usr/local/..., you just need to pass the 
 argument "prefix=/usr" to make.    

 If, on the other hand, all you wanted to do was to install the binaries
 in a normal binary directory, you can do this with the argument
 "csscutildir=/usr/local/bin" to make. 

 The program "sccs" (from the subdirectory bsd) is sensitive to the
 setting of $(csscutildir) at compile time, because it compiles in the
 value of that option as the default place to find the various
 subprograms.

 mkdir work
 cd work
 ../configure
 make

2.	Testing 

 Two types of tests are included with CSSC.  First, the unit tests in
 the subdirectory "unit-tests".  These mostly test individual classes
 or modules of CSSC (as opposed to running the CSSC binaries).
 Second, there are regression tests in the subdirectory "tests".  The
 regression tests are run on the built CSSC binaries.

 The unit tests are much newer than the regression tests and for the
 moment they have lower test coverage.

 To run all the tests (unit tests and regresion tests), run "make
 check" in the top-level directory:

 if make check 2>&1 | tee make.log 
 then
	echo SUCCESS
 else
	echo FAILURE
 fi

 This runs the unit tests first and if they succeed, the regression
 tests.  If either fails, take a look at "make.log".

 If you want to run just the unit tests, do this:
  cd unit-tests && make check

 If you want to run just the regression tests, do this:
  cd tests && make check

 Note that the regression test process accepts several environment
 variables which allow you to point it at a particular installation of
 the tools.  If you have used these variables for something else, the
 test will fail.  These variables are :-

 $dir, $get, $admin, $cdc, $prs, $prt, $delta, $sact, $sccsdiff,
 $unget, $what, $rmdel, $sccs

 If the regression tests failed, I'll definitely need some more
 information and so it would be best to keep the test outputs in case
 I need them in order to fix the bug ("tar cf failed-tests.tar tests"
 should do fine for that).  I may need to ask you to send a compressed
 version of this to me.

 If the unit tests failed, I only need you to send the stderr output
 (i.e. "make.log" from the example above).

 Valgrind will be used for the tests, if it is available and
 --disable-valgrind was not in the options passed to configure.  This
 slows the tests down quite a lot.  To prevent the use of valgrind,
 you can set the environment variable CSSC_DISABLE_VALGRIND.

3.	Installing
 cd work
 make install

==============================================================================

SCCS commands implemented this package are: admin, cdc, delta, get,
prs, prt, sccsdiff, rmdel, sact, sccs, unget, val and what.  Not all
options and capabilities of the commands have been implemented yet,
and the comb and help commands are not provided at all.  

You can use these tools to convert your SCCS repository to RCS or CVS
- to do this, you will also need the SCCS-to-RCS conversion script by
Jonathan Leffler (which should be included in the source distribution
of CVS).

Unimplemented features include the "-h" option of admin (use "val"
instead), ignored deltas (delta -g), l-files (get -l).  Some features
like including and excluding deltas (get -i -x) have been implemented
but not extensively tested.

See the file INSTALL for information on how to compile this package.
Send any questions or bug reports by e-mail to the <bug-cssc@gnu.org>
mailing list.  After you have compiled CSSC, _PLEASE_ run the test
suite, as described in docs/TESTING.  I'm particularly intersested in
success reports for platforms not in the "docs/Platforms" file.

To generate the manual, use one of these commands:

   To make the PDF format manual:        make pdf
   To make the PostScript format manual: make ps
   To make the DVI format manual:	 make dvi
   To make the HTML format manual:	 make html
   To make the Info format manual:	 make info

If you don't have TeX, you can read the "info" documentation with
either the GNU "info" program, or Emacs.


To regenerate all the machine-generated files from their ultimate
sources (for example, after checking the controlled sources out of a
CVS repository), use
	sh autogen.sh
followed by the usual invocation of "configure" and "make".
Alternatively, if you have a sufficiently new version of Autoconf
installed, you could just run "autoreconf".  However, if you do this,
some benign warnings will be generated for "testutils/configure.in".


The most helpful thing you could possibly do for this project would be
to contribute a new test case.  It isn't hard; the test scripts are
just shell scripts; instructions on how to do this are provided in the
manual.
