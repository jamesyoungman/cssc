/* This class exists to ensure that the standard file descriptors are

 * and then corrupt it since we don't realise that output to stdout or
 * stderr will go to it.
 *
 *
 * If any of the file descriptors 0, 1, 2 are not open, attach them
 * to /dev/null so that we don't fopen() a file, get a low numbered
 * file descriptor, and accidentally corrupt our file with a printf()
 * to stdout or stderr, or trying to read from stdin (hence changing
 * the file pointer on our file too).

/* We want to emit an error message.  If stderr has been closed, this

 *
 * We do this becauase (1) there isn't really a better option, and
 * (2) because the output will still show up in the strace(8) output
 * if the user really needs to track down the problem.
 *
 * If you have an idea for a better way of implementing it, please
 * feel free to do so; but remember, it needs to work when we just
 * failed to open() /dev/null.  So opening another file (e.g. /dev/log
 * with syslog) isn't going to work.
