This document describes the license only for the following files:

 docs/sccs.1
 docs/sccs.me
 src/sccs.c

All other parts of GNU CSSC are covered by the GNU general public
license (see the file COPYING).

Since I (James Youngman) have made a copyright assignment to the FSF
for my past and future work on CSSC, all my modifications to this code
are assigned to the FSF.  However, the coyright license I've used is
the original BSD license in acknowledgement of the fact that the
majority of the value of this code is provided by the original BSD
code; my modifications are needed to make it work with CSSC and to
make it portable to various systems etc.  While the FSF, being the
copyright holders, can license my modifications as they choose, I'd
prefer them to retain the BSD license for the contents of these files.


Please note that this copyright notice is not the same as the
"original" BSD copyright notice.  Specifically, the provision number 3
advertising condition has been removed.  This change is described in
the letter which is available on the BSD FTP site in the file
`README.Impt.License.Change'.  The provision which used to be numbered
4 has now been renumbered to 3.
